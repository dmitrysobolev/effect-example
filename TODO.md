# Effect Examples - Improvement Roadmap

This document tracks improvements to enhance the Effect library examples in this repository.

## High Priority

### 1. Expand Test Coverage for Scheduling Patterns ✅
- [x] Add tests for fibonacci schedule pattern
- [x] Add tests for linear schedule pattern
- [x] Add tests for circuit breaker with jitter
- [x] Add tests for batch processing with retry
- [x] Add tests for health check monitoring
- [x] Add timing assertions to verify jitter distribution
- [x] Increase scheduling test coverage from 74 to 850 lines (41 tests)

**Goal**: Match the comprehensive test coverage of concurrency patterns (446 lines) - **EXCEEDED** (850 lines)

### 2. Create Getting Started Examples ✅
- [x] Create `examples/` directory structure
- [x] Add `examples/quick-start.ts` with basic patterns
- [x] Add `examples/error-handling.ts` for typed error examples
- [x] Add `examples/concurrency-basics.ts` for parallel/race patterns
- [x] Add `examples/scheduling-basics.ts` for retry/backoff patterns
- [x] Add npm script: `npm run example <name>` to run specific examples
- [x] Document expected output for each example

### 3. Pattern Decision Guide ✅
- [x] Add "When to Use" section in README for concurrency patterns
- [x] Create decision flowchart: race vs parallel vs sequential
- [x] Add timing comparison table showing benefits of concurrency
- [x] Document trade-offs for different jitter strategies
- [x] Add "Common Pitfalls" section
- [x] Include real-world scenario mappings

## Medium Priority

### 4. Better Code Organization ✅
- [x] Evaluate splitting concurrency.ts into smaller modules
- [x] Evaluate splitting scheduling.ts into smaller modules

**Evaluation Result**: After analysis, decided NOT to split files because:
- Current files are reasonably sized (428 and 449 lines respectively)
- Both files are well-organized with clear section comments
- Splitting would reduce discoverability in a learning/examples repository
- Current structure better serves the educational purpose
- Import complexity would increase without meaningful benefits

**Alternative Approach**: Maintain current monolithic structure with excellent documentation.
See evaluation details in PR/commit message.

### 5. Missing Patterns & Examples

#### Resource Pooling ✅
- [x] Create `src/resource-pooling.ts`
- [x] Add database connection pool example
- [x] Add HTTP client pool example
- [x] Add tests for resource pooling
- [x] Document pool configuration best practices

**Implementation Details**:
- Created comprehensive resource pooling module with Effect.Pool
- Database connection pool with configurable min/max sizes
- HTTP client pool for concurrent requests
- 22 passing tests covering pool lifecycle, transactions, metrics, and error handling
- Advanced patterns: warmup, timeout, fallback, scoped connections
- Documented best practices, common pitfalls, and usage guidelines in README

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- [ ] Add `Effect.tapError()` examples for logging
- [ ] Add error recovery strategies beyond fail-fast
- [ ] Add error aggregation in concurrent operations
- [ ] Add examples of error context enrichment
- [ ] Add timeout error handling patterns

#### Circuit Breaker Enhancement
- [ ] Move circuit breaker to more prominent location
- [ ] Add visual state diagram for circuit breaker
- [ ] Add metrics/monitoring example
- [ ] Add integration with retry patterns
- [ ] Document when to use circuit breaker vs simple retry

### 6. Enhanced Documentation
- [ ] Add execution output examples to README
- [ ] Create visual flowchart for pattern selection
- [ ] Add performance comparison metrics
- [ ] Include "Before/After" code examples
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Document common error messages and solutions

## Low Priority

### 7. Developer Experience
- [ ] Add `npm run demo` command for interactive examples
- [ ] Create example picker CLI tool
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks with baseline tracking
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow for benchmark regression detection
- [ ] Create visual test output showing timing differences
- [ ] Add development tips to README

### 8. Advanced Topics
- [ ] Investigate `Effect.Stream` patterns (if applicable to Effect 3.0)
- [ ] Add distributed tracing examples
- [ ] Add metrics collection patterns
- [ ] Add integration examples with popular frameworks
- [ ] Add examples of custom operators
- [ ] Document advanced composition patterns

### 9. Build & Tooling
- [ ] Add bundle size analysis
- [ ] Create example playground with hot reload
- [ ] Add ESLint configuration for Effect best practices
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for tests
- [ ] Generate API documentation from JSDoc comments

## Optional Enhancements

### 10. Educational Materials
- [ ] Create tutorial series (beginner → advanced)
- [ ] Add video walkthrough references
- [ ] Create cheat sheet for common patterns
- [ ] Add comparison with Promise-based code
- [ ] Add migration guide from callbacks/Promises

### 11. Community
- [ ] Add CONTRIBUTING.md guide
- [ ] Create issue templates for new pattern requests
- [ ] Add example contribution template
- [ ] Link to Effect community resources
- [ ] Add showcase of real-world usage

## Progress Tracking

**High Priority**: 3/3 completed ✅
**Medium Priority**: 2/5 completed
**Low Priority**: 0/3 completed
**Optional**: 0/2 completed

**Overall**: 5/13 sections completed

---

## Notes

- Focus on completing High Priority items first
- Each completed item should include tests
- Update README.md as patterns are added
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Add comprehensive JSDoc comments for new code
