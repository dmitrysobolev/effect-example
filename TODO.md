# Effect Examples - Improvement Roadmap

This document tracks improvements to enhance the Effect library examples in this repository.

## High Priority

### 1. Expand Test Coverage for Scheduling Patterns ✅
- [x] Add tests for fibonacci schedule pattern
- [x] Add tests for linear schedule pattern
- [x] Add tests for circuit breaker with jitter
- [x] Add tests for batch processing with retry
- [x] Add tests for health check monitoring
- [x] Add timing assertions to verify jitter distribution
- [x] Increase scheduling test coverage from 74 to 850 lines (41 tests)

**Goal**: Match the comprehensive test coverage of concurrency patterns (446 lines) - **EXCEEDED** (850 lines)

### 2. Create Getting Started Examples ✅
- [x] Create `examples/` directory structure
- [x] Add `examples/quick-start.ts` with basic patterns
- [x] Add `examples/error-handling.ts` for typed error examples
- [x] Add `examples/concurrency-basics.ts` for parallel/race patterns
- [x] Add `examples/scheduling-basics.ts` for retry/backoff patterns
- [x] Add npm script: `npm run example <name>` to run specific examples
- [x] Document expected output for each example

### 3. Pattern Decision Guide ✅
- [x] Add "When to Use" section in README for concurrency patterns
- [x] Create decision flowchart: race vs parallel vs sequential
- [x] Add timing comparison table showing benefits of concurrency
- [x] Document trade-offs for different jitter strategies
- [x] Add "Common Pitfalls" section
- [x] Include real-world scenario mappings

## Medium Priority

### 4. Better Code Organization ✅
- [x] Evaluate splitting concurrency.ts into smaller modules
- [x] Evaluate splitting scheduling.ts into smaller modules

**Evaluation Result**: After analysis, decided NOT to split files because:
- Current files are reasonably sized (428 and 449 lines respectively)
- Both files are well-organized with clear section comments
- Splitting would reduce discoverability in a learning/examples repository
- Current structure better serves the educational purpose
- Import complexity would increase without meaningful benefits

**Alternative Approach**: Maintain current monolithic structure with excellent documentation.
See evaluation details in PR/commit message.
